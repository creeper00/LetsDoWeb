\
Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies. \
\
Currently supporting more than 25 platforms, Unity can be used to create 2D, 3D, VR, AR games, as well as simulations and other experiences. \
\
Unity is also used in other industries such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering and construction due to its capabilities in graphic design.\
\
Unity offers primary scripting API in **C#**, hence knowledge and experience in **C# programming** is required (and will be taught throughout this session).\
\
